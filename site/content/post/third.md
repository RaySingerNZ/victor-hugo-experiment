Find the Strata theme in Hugo’s theme library (or you can click here). To avoid headaches and to make it easy to tweak the theme we are just going to download the zip instead of cloning the theme’s repo. To do so, click the Clone or download button then click the Download ZIP button on the right hand side of the page. In the hugo/site directory, create a new folder called themes, then unzip the Strata file into /PATH/TO/hugo/themes.
